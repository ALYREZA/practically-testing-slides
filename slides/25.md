# Example Scenario 2

A. You're a startup and you haven't actually started selling your product yet
because it's not quite feature complete enough to be useful. You're running out
of money.

B. You just wrote a small function to calculate the distance your scrollable
list needs to scroll as the user presses the ArrowDown key and you're trying to
decide whether to test it.
