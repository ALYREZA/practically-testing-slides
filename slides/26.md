# Example Scenario 3

A. You notice there's no visual indication when a
user is focused on a button which is an
accessibility bug caused by some misapplied CSS.
Should only take a minute or two to fix that.

B. Next week, the sales team is demoing a feature
you've just finished implementing and you have a
few extra tests to add before you can mark it as
completed.
