# Example Scenario 4

A. You just put out a production fire. This is the
third time for the same bug that you know is hard
to write a test for, but you also expect it to
show up again.

B. The marketing team just announced the launch
date of a new feature you're responsible for.
Things were already tight before you had to deal
with the production fire. Now you're worried
whether you'll get that feature done in time.
